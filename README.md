 # GUEST_RECORD_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
The guest record management system in C++ project is a very practical and beneficial project that explains the administration and precise management method of recording data and dossiers. The user would be able to accomplish a wide range of tasks using this project. This project's source code teaches us how to use linked lists effectively, as well as how to write large, massive, and complex projects with various classes, functions, and features. All processing duties will be performed automatically by this new system. The admin will have the ability to add, delete, and alter services and records. During registration, administrators must just submit their basic information for the numerous services they have purchased.
